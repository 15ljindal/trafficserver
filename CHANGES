Changes with Apache Traffic Server 2.1.0

  *) Support for TCL v8.6 and later [TS-246].

  *) Support for many more platforms, including FreeBSD, MacOSX and Solaris.

  *) Code cleanup to get the ATS software into a distributable shape. This
   means that certain things are missing, or not functional (intentionally).
