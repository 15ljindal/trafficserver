PATCHES ACCEPTED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:

PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

  Range acceleration fix: Disable range acceleration by changing
  is_pread_capable to always return false. Put the current code in an
  #if 0 so it can be enabled for those willing to risk it. This issue
  is fixed on 3.3.X but the patch is much too large to backport.
  Jira: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TS-1575
  Patch: https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12553896/0001-Fix-for-Range-bug-on-3.2.x.patch

  Fix ARM build failures by adding ARM barrier intrinsics which actually do
  something. This fixes build failues on the ARM port after promoting the
  header filter module to main. The patch denoted below originally was
  contributed by a Debian porter. The original issue was discussed in TS-1473.
  A no-op fix was proposed to be backported and committed as TS-1498. However,
  later TS-1560 was committed to trunk as an improved version of the same
  problem.
