PATCHES ACCEPTED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:

PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

  *) HttpSM: TS can hang on HTTPS POST requests.
   Trunk patch: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1228988
   Jira: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TS-1049
   +1: zwoop, niq
   niq comments:  This patch combines the bugfix with no-op stylistic
                  changes.  Not a big deal for a simple change, but in
                  general it risks complicating review.

  *) key->volume hash table is not consistent when a disk is marked as bad or removed due to failure
   Trunk patch: https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=trafficserver.git;a=commit;h=b2109cdaf55234621d6c3b2fcb4f15774f0939ab
   Jira: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TS-949
   +1: zym
   -0: zwoop (I think this breaks compatibility with existing 3.0.x
   caches, and I'm not positive it's a good idea to do so).

  *) crash in RangeTransform::handle_event
   master SHA: 6c4d2b5005cde3aac142b7419cbf37ea4a21f0e5
   Jira: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TS-1111

   master SHA: ad6c4ab97ff150727660f66aa64b0fb57fd3d3f7
   Jira: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TS-1109
   +1: zym, zwoop

        the jira what's being proposed for backport)

  *) Make RC script support Amazon EC2 Linux AMI
   master SHA: 620d3cc783c330da00cdbe11eb72eddd1e7aff30
