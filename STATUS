PATCHES ACCEPTED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:


PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

  *) HTTP: We do not honor / use the configuration option for
     proxy.config.http.forward.proxy_auth_to_parent.
   Trunk patch: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=1154744
   Jira: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TS-906
   +1: zwoop, jim
   igalic asks: Does this break ABI or am I just imagining?
   jim asks: how so? Doesn't look like it...
   igalic: Okay then, +1!

  *) SSL: doesn't work on Solaris.
   Trunk patch: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=1196822

   Jira: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TS-1011
   +1: zwoop, igalic
   igalic says: n.b.: TS-1018 removes the default of blocking SSL, when
   acceleration is not enabled (which was never the case) - should we
   backport that as well?

  *) SSL: Allow ssl_multicert.config to support CA chains per host.
     origin TS-1013, and TS-994 is a depend issue.
