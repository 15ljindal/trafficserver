  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

  * remap: If we encounter parsing errors of remap.config, i.e. a broken
           configuration, we end up adding it to the remap containers
           anyways. This is not a broken configuration, it's also a
           configuration that is free()'d back to the heap. This is bad.
