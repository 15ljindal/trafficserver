PATCHES ACCEPTED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:

  Fix ARM build failures by adding ARM barrier intrinsics which actually do
  something. This fixes build failues on the ARM port after promoting the
  header filter module to main. The patch denoted below originally was
  contributed by a Debian porter. The original issue was discussed in TS-1473.
  A no-op fix was proposed to be backported and committed as TS-1498. However,
  later TS-1560 was committed to trunk as an improved version of the same
  problem.
