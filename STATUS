PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT FROM TRUNK:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]


  *) API: Wrong implementation of TSHttpSsnArgGet().
   Trunk patch: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1220600
   Jira: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TS-1055
   +1: zwoop, igalic

  *) Traffic Cop: segment fault when TRACE_LOG_COP is enabled
   Trunk patch: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1225724
   Jira: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TS-1065
   +1: igalic, zwoop

  *) HttpSM: TS can hang on HTTPS POST requests.
   Trunk patch: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1228988
   Jira: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TS-1049
   +1: zwoop, niq
   niq comments:  This patch combines the bugfix with no-op stylistic
                  changes.  Not a big deal for a simple change, but in
                  general it risks complicating review.

  *) PluginVC should schedule to the local queue instead of the external queue.
   Trunk patch: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1228526
   Jira: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TS-1074
   +1: briang, zwoop

   Trunk patch: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1197133
   Jira: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TS-1004
   +1: briang, zwoop

  *) API: TSHttpTxnServerReqHdrBytesGet in InkAPI.cc has an extra param.
   Trunk patch: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1236880
   Jira: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TS-1061
   +1: zwoop, igalic

  *) forward map based on request receive port
   Trunk patch: (see TS876.fixed.patch in JIRA)
   Jira: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TS-876
   +1: briang, zwoop

  *) do not reload bad remap.config
   Trunk patch: https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=trafficserver.git;a=commit;h=31500d106e472a8713c1c3976b161f2dea56ba38

     https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=trafficserver.git;a=commit;h=c2ddca4fac3d5cbacae27cddba87fe07c8651ec0
   Jira: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TS-948
   +1: zym, zwoop

  *) key->volume hash table is not consistent when a disk is marked as bad or removed due to failure
   Trunk patch: https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=trafficserver.git;a=commit;h=b2109cdaf55234621d6c3b2fcb4f15774f0939ab
   Jira: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TS-949
   +1: zym
   -0: zwoop (I think this breaks compatibility with existing 3.0.x
   caches, and I'm not positive it's a good idea to do so).


STALLED ISSUES

  *) IOCORE: Fix for cross thread closing of VCs.
   Trunk patch: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1201397
   Jira: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TS-857
   +1: zym, ericb
   -1: amc, zwoop [I believe this is the base cause of the 3.1.1 instability]
   Note: we have find that something need to be fixed after TS-857, we'd like
     this patch to be merge later and leave some time for us to find out how to
     fix it. we are now testing the fix.
